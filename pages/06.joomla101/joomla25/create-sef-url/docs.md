When SEO is enabled, your links will be in human-readable format and this will help your website rank higher in search results.

To enable SEO for your Joomla website, follow the steps below:

Enable `mod_rewrite` If you are not sure, please contact your hosting provider. Then rename the `htaccess.txt` file in your Joomla installation directory to `.htaccess`
Enable Joomla's SEO functionality from `Site => Global` configuration in the Site administration panel.
In the SEO Settings section change `Search Engine Friendly URLs` and Use URL rewriting to Yes.
Click on `Save` from the top right menu.
