##Before you begin
Xpert Contents doesn't work without some content, so the first thing you will need to do is create some Joomla or K2 or EasyBlog articles. If you have a Expert Explorer package that includes Xpert Contents, you can view the demo content for an example.

You should first create a new category or select one that you wish to display articles from. Then place new articles into it with your content. Make sure to provide intro text and if you wish an image, as these are what is used to display the snippets.

Once you have your selection of content ready, you can then start to work with Xpert Contents.

##Troubleshooting
<em>**Do i need jQuery?**</em>
Yes this module require it.

<em>**Article not scrolling, why?**</em>
This is possible for a few reasons. If jQuery is already included on your site by the template or another extension, then make sure to disable it in in XpertContents. Sometime another extension load jquery, make sure jquery loaded only once in header and top of all script.

<em>**Image not showing, why?**</em>
Make sure your image path is ok and you have no **/** beginning of your image path. For K2 article it looks for article image not image from introtext, so make sure you have article image for each article.

<em>**Text not showing, why?**</em>
Make sure you have some text in your article and you've turned on **show introtext**&nbsp;option form module settings.

<em>**I can't save or apply admin settings, why?**</em>
We recommend to use Firefox 4+/Chrome/Safari/Opera for admin management. It has some problem saving settings from **Internet Explorer**.
