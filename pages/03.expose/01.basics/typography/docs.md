## Adding New Google Fonts
Adding new Google font is really simple. There is a gfonts.txt file under your ```templates/TEMPLATES/``` folder. You need to delete the file and browse the template settings page. Expose will then fetch all the latest Google fonts and re-generate the file again and you can see the fonts on font drop-down.
