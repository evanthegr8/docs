<p class="alert alert-danger">Please make sure you have read and understand the license and usage requirements before deploying a template based on the Expose Framework</p>

The Expose Framework is free and released under the GPLv3.0 license. The definition of this license as stated on Wikipedia is:

>The GPL is an example of a powerful copyleft license that requires derived works to be available under the same copyleft. Under this philosophy, the GPL grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the free software definition and uses copyleft to ensure the freedoms are preserved, even when the work is changed or added to. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses are the standard examples.

## Usage

You are free to use the Expose Framework for your personal and commercial projects. You do not have to keep the Expose or ThemeXpert links and logos in the frontend, however you must ensure that all copyright notices in the code are retained. Also if you intend to use the Expose Framework in a commercial project, or a template you intend to redistribute in any form, please retain a Powered by Expose logo and link in the backend administrative interface.
